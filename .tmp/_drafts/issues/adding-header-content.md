# Inserting Overlay Content Into Header 


## Summary
I want to add overlay content to the header, specifically to overlay on top of the Header Image.


## Details
I have written the HTML/Liquid and SCSS and it all works when I test it outside of the site build, but I wanted to know how to add this overlay content into the header of all pages using the `_masthead.html`. The goal is to insert a *widget* of sorts with variable content.


### The Files
The repository can be found [here](https://github.com/NewSpectrum/Technovine-Site), and the individual components are:
- [`_masthead.html`](https://github.com/NewSpectrum/Technovine-Site/blob/8675ec3e0ddaf5e9acc454c2d9c49a8f64ed4349/_includes/_masthead.html)

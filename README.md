# Technovine Solutions

This is the source repository for the Technovine Solutions website, built by Jekyll and hosted with GitHub Pages.



## Development

### Testing Locally

Use the `jekyll serve` command to test locally. This will start a local web server at `http://localhost:4000` and will automatically rebuild the site whenever you make changes.

```bash
jekyll serve
```

## Why is it Important

It is widely known that communication is a key component to any successful business whether this occurs from supervisor to subordinate or from the marketing team to the operations department. The dissemination of information within a company is crucial to the overall performance of that organization. __Telecommunications__ enable individuals and groups to communicate with each other across long distances, regardless of their location; allowing the several different elements of your business to transfer information and instructions.
